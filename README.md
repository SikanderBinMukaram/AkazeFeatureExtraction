<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

I wanted to implement the akaze feature extraction on android using opencv for which I couldn't find any good example online. This one I made using Opencv and help from some blogs as mentioned in Acknowledgements.
What it has now is:
* Live feed from camera using opencv
* Feature detection on each frame 
* Visualising the keypoints in each frame.
* Double tap to select keyframe and start matching.
* Visualising the keypoints:
  * Green color shows the matched points, 
  * Blue color shows the current frame keypoints.
